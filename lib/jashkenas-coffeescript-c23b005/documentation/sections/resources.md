    Use `bin/coffee` to test your changes,<br>
    `bin/cake test` to run the test suite,<br>
    `bin/cake build` to rebuild the full CoffeeScript compiler, and<br>
    `bin/cake build:except-parser` to recompile much faster if you’re not editing `grammar.coffee`.

    `git checkout lib && bin/cake build:full` is a good command to run when you’re working on the core language. It’ll refresh the `lib` folder (in case you broke something), build your altered compiler, use that to rebuild itself (a good sanity test) and then run all of the tests. If they pass, there’s a good chance you’ve made a successful change.
*   [Browser Tests](/v<%= majorVersion %>/test.html)<br>
    Run CoffeeScript’s test suite in your current browser.
*   [CoffeeScript Issues](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/issues)<br>
    Bug reports, feature proposals, and ideas for changes to the language belong here.
*   [CoffeeScript Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/coffeescript)<br>
    If you’d like to ask a question, the mailing list is a good place to get help.
*   [The CoffeeScript Wiki](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki)<br>
    If you’ve ever learned a neat CoffeeScript tip or trick, or ran into a gotcha — share it on the wiki. The wiki also serves as a directory of handy [text editor extensions](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/Text-editor-plugins), [web framework plugins](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/Web-framework-plugins), and general [CoffeeScript build tools](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/Build-tools).
*   [The FAQ](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/FAQ)<br>
    Perhaps your CoffeeScript-related question has been asked before. Check the FAQ first.
*   [JS2Coffee](http://js2coffee.org)<br>
    Is a very well done reverse JavaScript-to-CoffeeScript compiler. It’s not going to be perfect (infer what your JavaScript classes are, when you need bound functions, and so on…) — but it’s a great starting point for converting simple scripts.
*   [High-Rez Logo](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/tree/master/documentation/images)<br>
    The CoffeeScript logo is available in SVG for use in presentations.
