## Installation

The command-line version of `coffee` is available as a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) utility. The [core compiler](/v<%= majorVersion %>/browser-compiler/coffee-script.js) however, does not depend on Node, and can be run in any JavaScript environment, or in the browser (see [Try CoffeeScript](#try)).

To install, first make sure you have a working copy of the latest stable version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). You can then install CoffeeScript globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install --global coffeescript
```

This will make the `coffee` and `cake` commands available globally.

When you need CoffeeScript as a dependency of a project, within that projectâ€™s folder you can install it locally:

```bash
npm install --save coffeescript
```

The `coffee` and `cake` commands will first look in the current folder to see if CoffeeScript is installed locally, and use that version if so. This allows different versions of CoffeeScript to be installed globally and locally.
