## If, Else, Unless, and Conditional Assignment

**If/else** statements can be written without the use of parentheses and curly brackets. As with functions and other block expressions, multi-line conditionals are delimited by indentation. There’s also a handy postfix form, with the `if` or `unless` at the end.

CoffeeScript can compile **if** statements into JavaScript expressions, using the ternary operator when possible, and closure wrapping otherwise. There is no explicit ternary statement in CoffeeScript — you simply use a regular **if** statement on a single line.

```
codeFor('conditionals')
```
