## Switch/When/Else

**Switch** statements in JavaScript are a bit awkward. You need to remember to **break** at the end of every **case** statement to avoid accidentally falling through to the default case. CoffeeScript prevents accidental fall-through, and can convert the `switch` into a returnable, assignable expression. The format is: `switch` condition, `when` clauses, `else` the default case.

As in Ruby, **switch** statements in CoffeeScript can take multiple values for each **when** clause. If any of the values match, the clause runs.

```
codeFor('switch')
```

Switch statements can also be used without a control expression, turning them in to a cleaner alternative to if/else chains.

```
codeFor('switch_with_no_expression')
```
