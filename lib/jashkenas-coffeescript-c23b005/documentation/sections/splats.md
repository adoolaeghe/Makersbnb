## Splatsâ€¦

The JavaScript **arguments object** is a useful way to work with functions that accept variable numbers of arguments. CoffeeScript provides splats `...`, both for function definition as well as invocation, making variable numbers of arguments a little bit more palatable.

```
codeFor('splats', true)
```
